Why Sky Tower? We are a unique group of people that fell under one roof to be as creative as possible. We love making films/videos but more importantly we love telling stories. Whatever it takes to tell the story right...we will do it. Taking the time to do things right the first time is something we pride ourselves in and expect no less. Once you work with Sky Tower Films you won't want to go anywhere else for your production needs. With our experience, skills, talent and passion for film we can make anything happen! What do we do? We make killer films and videos! Production quality is our highest priority. If the video needs graphics, we can make it. If  it needs cinematic scores we can get it. If it needs to strike the heart of a viewer, we can create it! There is no job too big or too small for Sky Tower Films. We enjoy the challenge that each project presents and guarantee it will be the best it can be! "From script to screen"...but what does that mean? Basically we can do everything from the intail idea to the final delivery wheither it to you or the broadcast stations. Here is a list but not limited to: Consolation Meeting Mood Boards Treatment/Pitch Scripting Shot Lists Lighting Plots Schedules  Call Sheets Production Equipment (including rentals) Casting Dalies Timeline edits Motion Graphics Color-grading Roughcut's and Finals Deliver in any formate and more! How much does it cost? There is no particular formula for each video or film. Each project is unique in it's own way. We know how to generate the biggest bang for your buck without sacrificing quality. Films and videos aren't cheap and yes we make it look easy but trust us, it is  not easy!  It's not uncommon to see us burning the midnight oil to get the project out the door...why...because we love it. The best thing you can do if you have questions is call, email, or drop in to talk with us. Once we understand your needs we can put a package/bid together tailored just for you and your project.. Just remember , anyone can put together a video these days...but can they make it a GREAT video or film? At Sky Tower WE CAN!!!
